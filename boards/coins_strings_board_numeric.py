from:"Chapter 16: Dots-and-Boxes", Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays, Volume 2: Games in Particular, Academic Press, pp. 507â€“550.
Dots and Boxes has a dual graph form called "Strings-and-Coins".
 This game is played on a network of coins (vertices) joined by strings (edges).
 Players take turns cutting a string.
 When a cut leaves a coin with no strings, the player "pockets" the coin and takes another turn.
 The winner is the player who pockets the most coins.
 Strings-and-Coins can be played on an arbitrary graph
